Credit card default prediction involves using analytical approaches, such as data analysis techniques and statistical methods, to forecast the likelihood of an individual failing to repay their outstanding debt. This process typically includes:

1. **Utilizing Alternative Variables**: Beyond traditional variables like income, assets, and payment history, incorporating geographical, behavioral, and consumption data can provide valuable insights into a customer's profile.
2. **Individual Credit Scoring**: Treating credit scores at an individual level to better assess risk.
3. **Behavioral Profile Analysis**: Analyzing customer behavior to predict potential defaultsÂ¹Â³.

This approach helps financial institutions improve their credit granting processes and manage risk more effectively.
