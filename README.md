# <p align="center">  ðŸ’³ Credit Card Defaults Prediction

This repository aims to develop a predictive model for assessing credit card default risks, encompassing data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning for accurate predictions.

Credit card default prediction involves using analytical approaches, such as data analysis techniques and statistical methods, to forecast the likelihood of an individual failing to repay their outstanding debt. This process typically includes:

1. **Incorporating Alternative Variables**: Adding geographical, behavioral, and consumption data to traditional factors like income, assets, and payment history enhances customer profiling.

2. **Individual Credit Scoring**: Evaluating credit scores on an individual basis for improved risk assessment.

3. **Behavioral Profile Analysis**: Assessing customer behavior to forecast potential defaults.

This strategy enables financial institutions to refine their credit granting processes and manage risk more efficiently.

## **Executive Summary**

This project aims to predict credit card defaults using a **Logistic Regression** model. Our primary focus is identifying significant factors such as payment history, educational level, and customer age, which influence the likelihood of default. The results of this project will help financial institutions make better decisions regarding risk management.


## **Introduction**

Predicting credit card defaults is crucial for financial institutions. It allows them to better manage risks and prevent financial losses by identifying customers who are likely to default on their payments. This study uses a dataset of credit card customers and applies **Logistic Regression**, a common technique for binary classification, to predict default risk.

## **Theoretical Framework**

- **Definition of Default**  
  Default occurs when a customer fails to meet their financial obligations within the specified timeframe. For financial institutions, this represents a significant risk, as recovering the money owed can be difficult and costly.

- **Credit Analysis and Predictive Modeling**  
  Credit analysis evaluates a customerâ€™s financial profile, while predictive modeling anticipates future behavior, such as the likelihood of default, based on historical data.
